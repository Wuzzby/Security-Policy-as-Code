# Logging and Monitoring Policy

## 1. Purpose

The purpose of this policy is to establish requirements for the logging, monitoring, and review of events occurring within the organizationâ€™s information systems. Logging and monitoring are essential for detecting security incidents, ensuring system availability, and meeting compliance obligations.

---

## 2. Scope

This policy applies to all systems that process, transmit, or store organizational data, as well as to users responsible for deploying, maintaining, or auditing those systems.

---

## 3. Policy Statement

The organization must generate, protect, and review audit logs for critical systems and user activities. Logs must be sufficient to:
- Reconstruct security events (e.g., login attempts, configuration changes)
- Monitor for unauthorized or suspicious activity
- Satisfy legal, regulatory, and audit requirements

## 4. Roles and Responsibilities

| Role                | Responsibility                                                |
|---------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------|
| IT/Security Team    | Configure and maintain logging systems                        |
| System Owners       | Ensure appropriate logging is enabled on their systems        |
| GRC Team            | Define retention and review requirements; ensure compliance   |
| Incident Response   | Use logs during investigations and root cause analysis        |

---

## 5. Policy Requirements

### 5.1 Log Generation
- All production systems must generate logs for key events, including:
  - Authentication attempts (success/failure)
  - Privileged command usage
  - System errors, application crashes
  - Changes to user roles or configurations
- Log sources must include endpoints, servers, firewalls, and cloud services.

### 5.2 Log Protection
- Logs must be written to a secure, centralized logging system (e.g., SIEM).
- Logs must be time-stamped, tamper-evident, and protected from unauthorized access.
- Raw logs must not be edited or deleted manually.

### 5.3 Log Retention
- Audit logs must be retained for a minimum of **365 days**, unless otherwise required by law or regulation.
- Archival logs must be encrypted and stored securely.

### 5.4 Log Monitoring and Review
- Security events must be continuously monitored (real-time or near-real-time).
- Critical alerts (e.g., brute-force attacks, admin privilege escalation) must trigger automated notifications.
- Logs must be reviewed at least **weekly** for anomalies or indicators of compromise.

### 5.5 Integration with Incident Response
- Logs must be preserved and extracted for forensic analysis in the event of a security incident.
- The IR team must have immediate access to logs related to affected systems.

---

## 6. Exceptions

All exceptions to this policy must be:
- Documented with a justification
- Approved by the GRC or Security Governance team
- Time-bound and reviewed periodically

---

## 7. Compliance

Violations of this policy may result in disciplinary action, system access suspension, or contractual penalties for third-party vendors.
