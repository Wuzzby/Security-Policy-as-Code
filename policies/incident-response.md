## 5. Policy Requirements

### 5.1 Definition of an Incident
An incident is any event that:
- Results in unauthorized access to data or systems
- Disrupts normal operations (e.g., ransomware, DoS)
- Violates company policies or acceptable use guidelines
- Triggers a legal, regulatory, or contractual obligation

> Examples: Phishing emails, malware infections, insider misuse, data leaks, failed login attempts across systems

---

### 5.2 Incident Lifecycle Phases

#### a. Preparation
- Maintain and train a designated Incident Response Team (IRT)
- Define escalation paths and severity classifications
- Ensure availability of response tools (e.g., forensic tools, contact trees, playbooks)

#### b. Detection and Reporting
- Monitor systems and SIEM for suspicious activity
- All users must report suspected incidents within 1 hour of discovery

#### c. Containment
- Isolate affected systems and accounts to prevent lateral movement
- Notify stakeholders and log all actions taken

#### d. Eradication and Recovery
- Remove malware or unauthorized users
- Reimage affected systems, patch vulnerabilities
- Restore systems from clean backups and validate their integrity

#### e. Post-Incident Review
- Conduct a "lessons learned" session
- Update playbooks and detection rules
- Report metrics to leadership and regulators if applicable

---

### 5.3 Documentation and Tracking
- All incidents must be documented in the Incident Register
- Incident records must include: date/time, reporter, severity, impact, response actions, root cause, and closure

---

### 5.4 External Notifications
- The Legal and GRC teams will determine if regulatory disclosure is required (e.g., GDPR, HIPAA, state breach laws)
- Notifications must occur within required timeframes (e.g., 72 hours under GDPR)

---

## 6. Exceptions

Exceptions to this policy are not allowed for active incident handling. All procedural deviations must be approved by the CISO or GRC lead after the incident is contained.

---

## 7. Compliance

Violations of this policy—including failure to report incidents—may result in disciplinary action, up to and including termination. Vendors may be subject to penalties per contract.
