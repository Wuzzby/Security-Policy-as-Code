# Access Control Policy

## 1. Purpose

The purpose of this policy is to define the requirements and responsibilities for controlling access to information systems and data. Effective access control ensures that only authorized users can access resources appropriate to their role and level of trust, in alignment with the principle of least privilege.

---

## 2. Scope

This policy applies to all employees, contractors, and third-party users who access organizational systems, applications, or dataâ€”whether on-premises or remotely.

---

## 3. Policy Statement

The organization must ensure that:
- Access to systems is granted only after formal authorization and approval.
- Each user is assigned a unique user ID and authentication method (e.g., password, MFA).
- Access rights are aligned to job responsibilities and reviewed periodically.
- Privileged access (e.g., administrators, domain admins) is tightly controlled and logged.
- Dormant or inactive accounts are disabled after 30 days of inactivity.
- Access is promptly revoked when employees leave the organization or change roles.
