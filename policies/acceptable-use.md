# Acceptable Use Policy (AUP)

## 1. Purpose

The purpose of this Acceptable Use Policy (AUP) is to define the responsibilities and behaviors expected from all users who access the organizationâ€™s information systems, networks, and data. This policy is designed to protect the company from risks such as data breaches, legal liability, and reputational harm.

> _Why this matters:_ Most incidents start with end-user behavior. AUPs are a foundational control for HR, legal, and GRC teams to reduce human-originated risk.

- All employees, contractors, and third-party users

## 3. Policy Statement
