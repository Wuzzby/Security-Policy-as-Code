# Security-Policy-as-Code

This repository contains a modular, version-controlled set of security policies written in Markdown and mapped to NIST 800-53 Rev. 5 and ISO/IEC 27001:2022 controls. It is designed to simulate how real-world organizations document, manage, and enforce cybersecurity governance.

---

## Project Overview

This project demonstrates:

- Policy design aligned with major compliance frameworks (NIST, ISO)
- Control mapping and traceability
- Git-based version control for documentation governance
- Simulation of stakeholder review using GitHub Issues

It is designed as both a learning tool and a professional portfolio artifact for GRC, compliance, and cybersecurity analyst roles.

## Included Policies

| Policy Name              | Description                                                       |
|--------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `access-control.md`      | Defines user provisioning, privilege management, and RBAC rules   |
| `logging-and-monitoring.md` | Specifies logging requirements, log retention, and SIEM use   |
| `incident-response.md`   | Describes IR lifecycle, escalation procedures, and documentation  |
| `endpoint-security.md`   | Sets endpoint protection standards for laptops, VMs, and phones   |
| `acceptable-use.md`      | Clarifies responsible use of corporate systems and data           |

Each policy is scoped, versioned, and mapped to relevant controls.

## Control Framework Mappings

You can view the complete policy-to-framework crosswalk here:

➡ [GRC_Policy_Framework_Mappings.xlsx](mappings/GRC_Policy_Framework_Mappings.xlsx)

This document includes mappings for:
- NIST SP 800-53 Rev. 5
- ISO/IEC 27001:2022 Clauses

## GRC Skills Demonstrated

- Policy Development & Documentation  
- Framework Mapping (NIST, ISO)  
- Documentation Version Control  
- Cross-functional Process Simulation (reviews, exceptions)  
- Portfolio Presentation & Communication

---

## Simulated Workflows

- GitHub Issues were used to simulate policy review cycles
- Future additions may include:
  - Risk register
  - Audit checklist templates
  - Exception request forms

## Why This Matters

Strong GRC programs depend on clear, enforceable policies aligned to compliance frameworks. This project shows that I understand not just technical security—but how to govern it, enforce it, and present it professionally.
